    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the work in Python is done by loops.  Having a computer repeat a calculation or just keep trying something through a series of values is a lot of the power of computing, saving us from an awful lot of tedium.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to use `for` and/or `while` loops in nearly every Python program that you write for the rest of this class. And they should look pretty familiar: you've already used them, in the code.org exercises:\n",
    "* repeat 3 times\n",
    "* repeat until _sunflower_\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd argue that the first example from code.org is most like a `for` loop, where you generally have a set number of iterations, and the second is more like a `while` loop, where you keep going until some goal or value is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core syntax reference for a `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for iterable_variable in sequence:\n",
    "    code that runs each time\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will loop over the `sequence` you provide, unpacking each value into the `iterable_variable`. **This variable will hold an individual value, one at a time, for each loop through.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of things you'll have in a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "* declared and opened with a `for` keyword\n",
    "* a sequence that is being iterated over\n",
    "* an iterable variable to hold the variable contents of the sequence during each loop\n",
    "* a colon\n",
    "* white space (the indent) that defines where the executable code lives\n",
    "* the code block (\"suite\" if you're fancy) to be executed each loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important notes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* the iterable variable name can be literally any valid variable name and does not need to be declared previously\n",
    "* the colon at the end of the `for` line block is required and indicates that the declaration line is done\n",
    "* the `in` keyword separates the iterable variable name from the sequence\n",
    "* sometimes there is a sequence literal in the declaration line, but it could also be a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a good question with a weird answer.  Sequences are data types in Python that internally support sequencing.  That is, you can ask it \"what's next?\" and it can give you an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things aren't sequences, such as numbers (`int`s and `float`s).  You can try asking the number 1 \"what's next?\" but it doesn't know.  Are you counting by 1?  Are you counting by -1? Are you counting by .1?  The question is too ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things _are_ sequences. `range()` gives us a list, which is a sequence. We'll come back and look at lists in detail, soon, but for now, `range` is the only list-related thing you really need to grasp. More below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, spoiler: strings are sequences, too!   \n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the iterable variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give this variable any name you want (following the standard variable name rules), and it doesn't need to exist before the loop declaration.  It will feel strange, that you are typing in this variable to be used that doesn't yet have a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop takes care of it for you.  It will make all the assignment statements for that sequence to that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then it will persist after the for loop has completed! (This isn't true in other languages.)\n",
    "\n",
    "More on this as we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps for setting up a `for` loop.  We'll be going through all of these in much more detail as we work through examples. This section is just to set up your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Determine what kind of pattern you'll be executing.  \n",
    "    * This is a thinking stage, where you need to think through what kind of pattern will move your program forward.\n",
    "2.  Identify your sequence.\n",
    "    * Once you know the kind of pattern you want, this will help you determine the kind of sequence.  There are times when the sequence will be very clear to you, and others where you'll be crafting one (for example in a reference loop) to generate the values you need.\n",
    "3.  Give your iterable variable a good name.\n",
    "    * You can technically call it `kitten`, but that isn't helpful.  Think about what it is and try to name it, being sure that you are matching the plural correctly.  For example, if you are working over a sequence of numbers, you might want to call it `num`, or if it's a string you could call it `character`.  \n",
    "    * Be very careful not to repeat any of your previous variable names, as their previous values will be erased for the iterable variable's value.  You may end up blowing away your data and making weird things happen.  \n",
    "    * This name must also be different from the sequence's variable name (if it has one), because it might word and end up with really strange results."

    "\n",
    "As you are thinking of accumulators and counters, keep them separate in your head.  They look really similar in the code, but their purpose and usage will be very different!  You can have multiple of both inside your program, but commonly you'll have an accumulator to collect up many values, and then a counter to keep track of how many things you have counted.  There is an argument to be made that counters are a special type of accumulator, but I prefer to think of them as siblings rather than parent/child.\n",

This value must be accessed each time through, and that value is added up to create a final value representing the total number of years old all the students are in this room. \n",
