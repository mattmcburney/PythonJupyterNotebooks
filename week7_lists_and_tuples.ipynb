    "This week, we're exploring our first real **data collection** data type. We've seen data types before (strings, ints, floats, Booleans), but they were all more content-based.  Lists are more of a *container* data type, where you put other objects inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll want to make a list directly within your code, but many other times you are using a function, method, or other tool to create a list for you.  This means that you often start with content in another data type, do something to it, and then you end up with a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We got a little bit of a preview of lists when we learned about repetition--`for` and `while` loops. We iterated over a couple of simple lists and used `range()` to generate lists of numbers (well, technically, they weren't lists until we forced them into the list type... but close enough). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time for more detail!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# List quick facts we're going to explore in more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "* **lists are surrounded by `[]`**, so when you see that in the code or you see it surrounding an output that you're printing, you're looking at a list\n",
    "* lists can be empty, with a length of 0.  \n",
    "    * These appear as `[]`\n",
    "* **lists contain elements**, and when viewed in the list's content, those elements are visually separated by commas.  These are solely for our human eyes and not actually part of the content of the elements within the list (unless the commas are inside of that content, such as a string with a comma.\n",
    "    * example: `[1, 2, 3]` is a list of three integers, and `['hello', 'yes, I would like to science', 'I am a penguin']` is a list of three strings.  Note the commas that are outside of the strings are separating the three elements, but the comma inside of the string is just part of the string's content.  You'll get used to looking at this, but it'll take a little bit.\n",
    "* **lists can hold any kind of object, and types can be mixed within a single list**\n",
    "    * valid example list: `[\"sparrow\", 42, \"mourning dove\", 3.14]`\n",
    "* **lists have an order**\n",
    "    * `[1, 2, 3]` is a different list than `[3, 2, 1]`\n",
    "* **lists can be referenced element-by element and sliced** semi-spoiler: they use the same extraction syntax as strings\n",
    "* **lists can be looped over** in a regular `for` loop.  The loop will unpack the list by individual elements.  A list of three elements will make a loop execute three times, and the iterable variable will hold the element values one at a time.\n",
    "* **lists are mutable** - you can change the elements within a list while your program runs\n",
    "* **lists work differently than any other type we've met yet** - this is tied to the fact that they are mutable; you can call methods to change a list in place, and making copies of lists is messy (more on this later)\n",
