    "We have looked at several different methods of affecting our programs' _control flow,_ including conditionals (`if`/`elif`/`else`) and repetition structures (`for`/`while`). Functions represent our third control flow manipulation mechanism, giving us the power to jump from place to place in our program and to repeat code blocks with even more finesse than loops allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already used **built-in** functions like `min()` and `max()` &mdash; they take in a bunch of numbers as **arguments,** and they **return** the smallest or largest number (respectively) that they were given. Whenever you call `min()`, `max()`, or any other built-in function, you are using a piece of code that someone else has written. The difference in what we're doing now is that we will be **defining our own functions,** in addition to using Python's built-in functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some vocabulary. Seeing these definitions may not be incredibly helpful just yet, until you've got a little more context, but after we've looked at some concrete examples, it'll be good for you to have them to refer back to.\n",

    "* __define a function__:  this is where you define the name, parameters, and code for your functions.  You do this with your `def` block.  E.g. `def function_name():`\n",
    "* __call a function__:  this is when you actually call the function to execute, and you do this via `function_name()` somewhere else in your code\n",
    "* __parameters/arguments__:  these are the values you want to give the function when you call it; you can have 0 parameters/arguments (technically, \"parameters\" are what you create when you define the function, and \"arguments\" are what you use when you call it, but only really frustrating people will ever give you trouble for using the terms interchangeably)\n",
    "* __'passing' values__: this is how you give the function the arguments it needs to give you values back; \"passing\" means that the value is handed off in the system such that it can be saved and processed.  This is different from printing values, which just spits the value out to the console and you can capture and save that value.\n",

You'd have a really hard time reading (let alone debugging!) the code and understanding which `for` loop each piece of code belongs to.\n",

In this case, all the processing work has been sent out to `get_records()` and `process_record()`, so this might be all the code there is in the main processing section of our program.  This can make the whole program easier to understand, because all the processing and data manipulation elements have been isolated. \n",

Your plans may change as you start implementing&mdash;this is normal&mdash;but planning ahead is still important. You can revise your plan!\n",

    "    1. what do you want to name the function?\n",
    "        * follow normal variable naming protocols\n",
    "        * consider maybe using verbs (action words) for your function names\n",

    "        * Inputs (parameters) are optional, but you could have one or many coming in. There's other nuance here, but we're going to start with the most generic form.\n",
    "    3. what does the function need to do? (this answer may be very abstract when starting out)\n",
    "        * This is your 'do stuff' step.\n",
    "    4. what should the function return? or: what should the function give back to you\n",
    "        * While you _can_ choose not to return something, we won't usually be doing that.\n",
    "            - If you don't return something, your function probably has some other kind of **side effect** (fancy CS term for \"something happened, but it wasn't a return value\"), like changing a global variable (no, _don't do this_) or printing something to the console.\n",
    "        * You must pick _one and only one object_ to return. I know the book talked about returning multiple things, but we'll generally be sticking to returning a single string or number or Boolean value for the time being.\n",
    "            - yes, functions can absolutely return `True` or `False` \n",
    "2. **Defining phase** (remember that this phase only teaches Python about your function. None of the code in the body of the function is executed during this phase)\n",
    "    1. Add the `def` block line in, providing the function name you chose.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def my_function():` thus far\n",
    "    2. Add the parameter variables into the `()` of the def block\n",
    "        * Give these sensible names that you'll remember later.\n",
    "        * You will provide these **in the order that they should be provided when calling the function**, with the variable names separated by commas. Leave the `()` empty if you aren't requiring that the function take any input.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def my_function(thing1, thing2):` at this point\n",
    "    3. Inside the function definition block (so indented under the `def` line), add your do stuff items.\n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",

    "            some_local_variable = some operation involving thing1 & thing2, probably\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    4. Add your return statement (probably)\n",
    "        * this is a separate step because it will always be the last thing to happen in your function.\n",
    "        * it should come last because your function execution will immediately stop as soon as Python hits a `return` statement.\n",
    "        * `return` is a keyword and not a function, so there aren't any `()`.  Provide the single object that you want to return after the keyword. Do not actually add multiple items after this separated by commas; it wasn't nice of the book to show you that right now.   \n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",

    "            return some_local_variable # see? no ()!\n",

    "     5. **Your function is not finished unless there is a docstring** saying what it does and, ideally, describing what its inputs (parameters) and outputs (return value or side effects) should be.\n",
    "3. **Calling phase** (now is the time to make the code actually work. When you call the function, you are finally asking Python to execute the code in that function).\n",
    "    1. Somewhere later in your code, you'll call the function with the function's name and `()`.  You'll add this inside `main()` (more on that in a bit), and not inside your function definition. \n",
    "    2. Provide the arguments in the `()` according to how you defined it.  So if you said `def student(name, age):`, then you must provide those values in that order, a name _then_ an age. \n",
